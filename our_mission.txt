AI Camp's mission:
Prepare students for the real-life. 
AI Camp is something we wish we could have when we were students.
We went to Stanford, Caltech, and Cornell - best universities in the country. But when it comes to find a job after our Ph.D. programs, like many students, we struggled.
Our higher education put us in debt. 
We are not alone - 68% students graduate from universities with average debt of $30,000. Cumulatively, student debt is more than 1.5 trillion dollars, second only to mortgage.
And it does not prepare us for the real-life.
More than half of the graduates do not have a job at the time of their graduation. And it will take then more than 6 months to find a job.
AI Camp bridges the gap between schools and industries.
Students do not know what jobs are there, what to learn and have no network. We intent to bridge this gap through teaching AI and how to make a real AI product. 
Learn core data skills, roles and other important skills.
By guiding students to make a real AI product that people can use, we teach students how to think different roles and learn anything they want. This equips students with a framework to tackle the real-life.
The end results are an impressive AI product and successful students.
With this experience, students can take full advantage of their education.
Join us - make impressive AI products and prepare for your future.
