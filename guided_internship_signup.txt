 We're thrilled to announce that for the 2023 edition of Team Tomorrow Guided Internship, we have secured collaborations with leading companies and media agencies. Here are some exciting projects you can be part of:
 Co-create an AI executive coach with one of the nation's finest executive coaches, Keith Ferrazzi. Visit www.keithferrazzi.com for more inspiration.
Support influencers with their data and generative AI requirements.
Design a robust Q&A system for a Hollywood TV and Movie backoffice.
 Our alumni have accomplished tremendous feats, creating software for companies that raised an astounding $120M, or making a direct revenue impact exceeding $1M. They credit their growth and acceptance into their dream schools (such as Princeton and CMU) to their enriching journey with our Team Tomorrow Guided Internship and subsequent paid internships.
 However, please note, we offer a limited number of spots in our Guided Internship program due to the finite resources of our mentors and company partnerships. Priority will be given to our recommended students and loyal customers, after which we will invite top students from across the country to partake.
