Scope of Notice
This Cookie Notice supplements the information contained in the Privacy Notice by explaining how we and our business partners and services providers use cookies and related technologies in the course of managing and providing our Services and our communications to you. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them. 
In some cases, we may use cookies and related technologies described in this Cookie Notice to collect personal information, or to collect information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. For more details about how we process your personal information, please review the Privacy Notice.
  What Are Cookies and Related Technologies
Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer that allow us and our third-party partners and providers to collect certain information about your interactions with our email communications and Services.  We and our third-party partners and providers may also use other, related technologies to collect this information, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”).
What We Collect When Using Cookies
We and our third-party providers and partners may use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or interact with our email communications and other Services, including the personal information identified in the Personal Information Automatically Collected section of our Privacy Notice.  For example, we may collect log data about your device and its software, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, date/time of your visit, and other similar information.  We may also collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure usage and activity trends for our Services and better understand our customer/member base.
Our third-party providers and partners may also directly collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services.
How We Use That Information
We may use the data collected through cookies to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit our Services; (b) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Services; (c) monitor online usage and activities of our Services; (d) diagnose errors and problems with our Services; (e) otherwise plan for and enhance our Services; and (f) facilitate the other purposes identified in the Personal Information Automatically Collected section of our Privacy Notice.  We and our advertising partners also use the information we collect through cookies to understand your browsing activities, including across unaffiliated third-party sites, so that we can deliver information and advertisements about our Services that may be of interest to you. 
Please note that we link some of the personal information we collect through cookies with the other personal information that we collect about you and for the purposes described in the Our Collection of Personal Information and Our Use of Personal Information sections of our Privacy Notice.
Your Choices About Cookies
If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.  Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our Services, as some features and offerings may not work properly.  Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.  In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.  You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it. 
Many of our websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). For more information on the use of Google Analytics, please visit Google’s privacy policy here.  You can also view Google’s currently available opt-out options here.
Your Choices About Online Ads
To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources, at www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and you can opt-out of receiving some interest-based advertisements on mobile apps by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android).  You may also be able to opt-out of some — but not all — interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our Services.  It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAA’s Principles.
